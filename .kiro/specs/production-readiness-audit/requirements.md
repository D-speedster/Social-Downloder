# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive production readiness audit of the Telegram bot system. The audit aims to identify potential issues, bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities that could impact the bot's performance under heavy advertising load before launching a large-scale marketing campaign.

## Glossary

- **Bot System**: The complete Telegram bot application including all plugins, handlers, and dependencies
- **Heavy Load**: High volume of concurrent user requests expected from advertising campaigns
- **Audit Process**: Systematic examination of code, architecture, and configurations to identify risks
- **Critical Path**: Core functionality that must remain operational under all conditions
- **Bottleneck**: Any component that could limit system throughput or cause failures
- **Race Condition**: Concurrent execution issues that could cause data corruption or crashes
- **Resource Leak**: Memory, file handles, or connections that are not properly released
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Any component whose failure would cause complete system failure

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a bot owner preparing for advertising campaigns, I want a comprehensive analysis of all system components, so that I can identify potential failure points before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL examine all Python modules in the plugins directory for code quality issues
2. THE Audit Process SHALL identify all external service dependencies and their failure modes
3. THE Audit Process SHALL analyze database operations for potential bottlenecks and race conditions
4. THE Audit Process SHALL review all API rate limiting implementations
5. THE Audit Process SHALL document all findings in a structured report with severity levels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want to understand how the system behaves under concurrent load, so that I can ensure stability during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL identify all concurrent operations and their synchronization mechanisms
2. WHEN multiple users request downloads simultaneously, THE Audit Process SHALL verify proper queue management
3. THE Audit Process SHALL analyze thread safety of shared resources including database connections and file operations
4. THE Audit Process SHALL identify potential deadlock scenarios in the job queue system
5. THE Audit Process SHALL review the sponsor system for concurrent access issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want to identify resource management issues, so that the bot doesn't crash due to memory leaks or connection exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL identify all file operations and verify proper cleanup with context managers
2. THE Audit Process SHALL review database connection pooling and connection lifecycle management
3. THE Audit Process SHALL analyze memory usage patterns in download and upload operations
4. THE Audit Process SHALL identify any unclosed resources in exception handling paths
5. THE Audit Process SHALL review temporary file cleanup mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want to understand error handling coverage, so that failures are gracefully handled and logged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL identify all try-except blocks and verify appropriate exception handling
2. THE Audit Process SHALL verify that all external API calls have timeout and retry mechanisms
3. THE Audit Process SHALL review error logging completeness for debugging purposes
4. THE Audit Process SHALL identify any bare except clauses that could hide critical errors
5. THE Audit Process SHALL verify user-facing error messages are informative and actionable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want to identify security vulnerabilities, so that user data and bot operations remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL review all user input validation and sanitization
2. THE Audit Process SHALL identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
3. THE Audit Process SHALL verify secure handling of authentication tokens and cookies
4. THE Audit Process SHALL review file path operations for directory traversal vulnerabilities
5. THE Audit Process SHALL identify any hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want to understand the scalability limits of each component, so that I know when to implement optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL identify maximum concurrent user capacity based on current architecture
2. THE Audit Process SHALL analyze database query performance and identify missing indexes
3. THE Audit Process SHALL review download/upload bandwidth management
4. THE Audit Process SHALL identify components that could become bottlenecks at scale
5. THE Audit Process SHALL document recommended thresholds for monitoring and alerting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want to verify third-party service integration resilience, so that external service failures don't crash the bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL identify all third-party service integrations including YouTube, Instagram, Spotify
2. WHEN a third-party service is unavailable, THE Audit Process SHALL verify graceful degradation
3. THE Audit Process SHALL review cookie management and refresh mechanisms for reliability
4. THE Audit Process SHALL verify proxy rotation and fallback mechanisms
5. THE Audit Process SHALL identify any missing circuit breaker patterns for external services

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a bot owner, I want a prioritized action plan, so that I can address the most critical issues first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Process SHALL categorize all findings by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
2. THE Audit Process SHALL provide estimated impact for each identified issue
3. THE Audit Process SHALL recommend specific solutions or mitigations for each finding
4. THE Audit Process SHALL create a prioritized roadmap for addressing findings
5. THE Audit Process SHALL identify quick wins that can be implemented immediately
